      "###### 1. HEAD/CAP- Precision machined steel head and cap provide close concentricity and accurate alignment between piston, tube, piston rod and rod bearing. 2. CYLINDER BARREL- Damage resistant, heavy wall steel tubing, honed to an 8 to 16 micro finish for low frictional drag and maximum seal and piston bearing life. 3. ROD CARTRIDGE- Extra long, high strength bronze gland provides maximum bearing support and wear resistance. With certain exceptions, a removable retainer allows for gland removal without cylinder disassembly. 4. PISTON- One piece fine grained cast iron piston provides maximum strength and protection against shock loads. Anaerobic adhesive is used to permanently lock and seal the piston to the rod. 5. PISTON ROD- High strength damage resistant piston rod provides 100,000 PSI minimum yield material in 5/8” through 4 1/2” diameters. Larger diameters vary between 50,000 and 75,000 PSI minimum yield material. All rods are case hardened to 50-55 RC and hard chrome plated to provide maximum wear life. Stainless steel is also available. 6. TIE RODS- 100,000 to 125,000 PSI minimum yield steel, pre-stressed for fatigue resistance, and roll threaded for added strength. 7. CUSHIONS- Head cushion sleeve and rear cushion spear are machined to close tolerances to  provide a gradual deceleration and reduced shock at end of stroke.\n",

      "###### 8. CUSHION NEEDLE ADJUSTMENT AND BALL CHECK-  Flush mounted captive cushion adjustment allows for  safe cushion adjustment under pressure. Special tip  design and fine threads allow for precise adjustment  over a broad range of operations. Cushion ball check  allows for fast break-away under full power. 9. TUBE END SEALS- Extrusion resistant Teflon[®] material is compatible with virtually all fluids and can  operate in temperatures to 500°F. 10. PORTS- SAE ports are standard and can be rotated to any 90 degree position in relation to each other and the mounting. NPTF ports are optional at no  extra charge. 11. ROD SEAL- Twin lip urethane rod seal is pressure energized and wear-compensating for long, leak-free service. Viton[®] seals are optional. 12. PISTON SEALS- Pressure energized nitrile U-cups with back-up rings are standard. Step cut cast iron rings and Viton[®] seals are optional. 13. ROD WIPER- Nitrile double lip rod wiper acts as a secondary seal while keeping out dirt, dust and other contaminants. Optional Viton[®] wiper is available for fluid compatibility or temperatures to 400°F. Metallic scrapers and low friction wipers are also available.\n",

      "|STOP TUBE Stop tubes are installed between the piston and front head on long stroke cylinders. The stop tube lengthens the distance between the piston and the rod bearing and reduces load when fully extended. To determine if a stop tube is required and the length, first determine the value of “Y” from one of the illustrations above. If “Y” is less than 40”, no stop tube is needed. If “Y” is over 40”, a one inch stop tube is recommended for every 10” or fraction thereof over 40”. (see Chart 27-A) ROD DIAMETER SELECTION In most applications the standard rod size is suitable. On long stroke or high thrust applications, an oversized rod may be required. To arrive at the minimum rod size for your application, first determine the bore size, stroke, and thrust (See Page 148). Now select from the above illustration the type of mounting and determine the length “Y” with the piston rod in the fully extended position. Using Chart 27-B look for the maximum thrust for your cylinder, then look across for the “Y” length determined from the illustrations.

      "###### MOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS Yates Industries' fluid power cylinders can be found in many mounting configurations. The decision on the proper mount should take into consideration what style is best suited for the application at hand. We can break these mounts into 3 groups:\n",
      "\n",
      " CENTERLINE FORCE TRANSFER (Mounts include F,R,G,P,J,S,X,Z,K,L,M,N) These are cylinders with fixed mounts that absorb forces along their center-line in both thrust and tension applications. Mounting bolts are not subjected to compound forces and, if properly installed, sideload damage is removed, extending rod gland life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###### OFF-CENTERLINE FORCE TRANSFER (Mounts include A, B, E & Y) These are cylinders with fixed mounts that do not absorb forces along their centerline. These mounts tend to produce a twisting in the cylinder as it applies force to a load. To avoid problems, these cylinders must be securely mounted with loads well guided when possible. Depending on application, pinning the mounting lugs or adding an extended key plate may reduce side load to rod gland and piston bearings. Consult factory with questions or concerns with your application.\n",
      "\n",
      " PIVOT FORCE CYLINDERS (Mounts include C, V, DC, DV, Q, U, T & W) These cylinders absorb forces along their centerline and are used when the load must travel in a curved path.  The type of mount will depend on the load staying in one curved path or the need to pivot on two axis. Choose the mount based on your application and consult the piston rod selection chart on page 107. For long stroke applications, a larger rod diameter or stop tube may be required.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###### TYPES OF CYLINDERS\n",
      "\n",
      " DOUBLE ACTING CYLINDERS This is the most common type of cylinder. This type of cylinder is for use in applications where force is needed in both directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###### SINGLE ACTING CYLINDERS This type of cylinder is used when force is needed in only one direction, either extend or retract. Commonly the opposite end of the cylinder is vented to atmosphere, or in a hydraulic application the opposite port can be vented back to the tank. Depending on the application either gravity or the weight of the load will retract the cylinder.\n",
      "\n",
      " DOUBLE ROD CYLINDERS These cylinders can have load attached to both ends of the cylinder and work in both directions. Other applications for double rod cylinders include equal displacement on both sides of the cylinder, or operating switches of cams.\n",
      "\n",

      "-----\n",
      "\n",
      "###### SPRING CYLINDERS Spring cylinders have a spring built inside to extend, retract, or center the cylinder on its own or to assist pneumatic or hydraulic pressure. These cylinders are commonly used as clamp cylinders. Note that the addition of a spring can increase the length of a cylinder as much as 3 times or more.\n",
      "\n",
      " RAM CYLINDERS Ram cylinders are commonly known as displacement cylinders. Mainly used for long strokes where gravity or the weight of the load can retract the cylinder and are almost always mounted vertically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###### TELESCOPIC CYLINDERS Telescopic cylinders are commonly used in mobile equipment and machinery. The multiple “stages” of the cylinders allow applications to get long strokes with short retracted lengths and are available in single or double acting configurations.\n",
      "\n",
      " TANDEM CYLINDERS Tandem cylinders consist of two cylinders mounted inline together with one piston rod connecting both pistons together with one working rod end to gain increased output forces while having a compact design.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###### DUPLEX CYLINDERS\n",
      "\n",
      " Duplex cylinders are sometimes known as three position cylinders. They consist of two cylinders mounted inline together without having the pistons connected together by one common piston rod.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###### BACK TO BACK CYLINDERS\n",
      "\n",
      " Back to back cylinders consist of two cylinders mounted together on the cap or blind end. This lets both cylinders act separately from each other or together as in a double rod cylinder application.\n",

      "\n",
      " 1. Never exceed the current and voltage of the load with the selected switch. Failure to use proper load will ruin the switch. For DC voltages always observe polarity. 2. On two-wire versions, do not connect directly across the power supply without a series load. Failure to use a series load will damage the switch and possibly the power supply. 3. Never use a filament light bulb as a load test to the switch. Severe in-rush currents will damage the switch or cause premature failure. 4. Keep wire runs to a minimum. Longer wire runs will increase capacitive loading which may effect the life of the switch. 5. When actuating a solenoid with a switch, always use an external surge suppression. 6. At all times keep the area around the switch clean and free of potentially magnetic debris. 7. Be sure the sensing area of the switch is installed against the cylinder tube. 8. Consult factory if you have any additional questions regarding Reed and Hall effect switches.\n",

The image that is shown below represents a standard seal configuration, however, there are multiple types of seal configurations that can incorporate a drain- back gland design. Yates recommends piping the drain-back port, which is commonly a .125 inch NPTF, to the hydraulic fluid holding tank. Standard drain-back port position is #3 although this may vary based on application. Review Page 178 to reference drain back port location options. Please contact Yates for more details on other possible seal & drain-back gland options/configurations.\n",

      "###### INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      " This manual will help users store, install, maintain and, if needed, repair Yates cylinders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###### CYLINDER IDENTIFICATION\n",
      "\n",
      " Yates' N.F.P.A. series cylinders can be identifed by Yates serial number or model number. Cylinders are tagged with bore, stroke, and serial number on a metal tag attached to the head. In addition, the serial number is stamped into the steel of the front head. These numbers should always be referenced when requesting parts or for general service inquiries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###### STORING OF CYLINDERS\n",
      "\n",
      " If there is a need to store the cylinders for any period of time, please follow these simple instructions to help keep the cylinder in ready condition:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###### 1. Coat the interior of the cylinder with oil and leave half flled if practical.\n",
      "\n",
      " 2. Plug all ports to ensure foreign matter is kept out of the cylinder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###### 3. Try to store the cylinder in a vertical position if at all possible; if not, regularly rotate the  cylinder 90 degrees to ensure seals maintain proper shape and elasticity.\n",
      "\n",
      " 4. Keep all mounting surfaces and threads either covered or coated with protective  lubricant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###### 5. Try to store components in a clean, dry area that maintains a relatively constant temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      " IF STORING FOR LONGER THAN ONE MONTH, ALWAYS THOROUGHLY LUBRICATE THE CYLINDER. STROKE NUMEROUS TIMES BEFORE INSTALLATION OR USING UNDER LOAD.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "-----\n",
      "\n",
      "###### INSTALLATION\n",
      "\n",
      " The preferred method of mounting the cylinder to a machine is to have the equipment machined to ft the cylinder's exact dimensions with proper alignment already taken into account so that mounting the cylinder ensures perfect alignment. Unfortunately, this is not always an option from a cost or design aspect so alignment must be ensured at time of installation. On fxed mount cylinders that are secured in one position, it is always best to bolt the cylinder down as the last step in installation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###### When attaching the piston rod end to the load, the piston rod must be attached and held squarely to ensure the centerline is parallel to the guides of the attached load or parallel to the line of movement along the entire stroke. Torque piston rod to load. Insert mounting bolts securely enough to cycle cylinder but do not tighten.\n",
      "\n",
      " The application operation should be cycled with low pressure air under reduced or no load to ensure that all components are operating freely. Finish torquing mounting bolts and re-check.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###### Piping: All fttings should be free of burrs and sealed with either o-ring or appropriate pipe tape. Make sure all hoses are properly fushed of contaminants before attachment. Do not overtighten fttings. On oversized rods, beware of shallow tapped ports.\n",
      "\n",
      " Hydraulic fltration should be to power unit manufacturer's specifcations. Pneumatic systems should have a water separator, 50 micron or smaller flter, and a lubricator as close to the cylinder as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###### MI 586.778.7680\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "-----\n",
      "\n",
      "###### TROUBLESHOOTING\n",
      "\n",
      " Cylinders that are properly installed and maintained should have millions of trouble-free cycles. Most failures are due to application or system problems that could be prevented. Some problems, possible causes and solutions follow:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###### BROKEN ROD END Cause: Misalignment or load in excess of cylinder capability. Solution: Make sure that load is properly aligned. Select larger rod end threads or stud rod end for greater strength.\n",
      "\n",
      " 2. BROKEN OR BENT ROD Cause: Misalignment or load in excess of cylinder capability. Solution: Make sure that rod is aligned properly through entire stroke. Consult a Yates sales representative to select proper rod size for application.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###### 3. SEAL DAMAGE Cause: Improper seal selection or system contamination. Solution: Consult a Yates sales representative for proper seal for temperature or fuid media. Use proper fltration from system manufacturer's spec.\n",
      "\n",
      " 4. EXCESSIVE PISTON ROD WEAR Cause: Side load or long stroke and improper stop tube selection. Solution: Check alignment of rod and load along entire stroke. Consult Yates catalog for proper stop tube confguration.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###### 5. BROKEN PARTS Cause: Exceeding cylinder pressure rating. Need for system speed controls or improperly adjusted  cylinder cushions. Solution: Lower system pressure to minimum required to accommodate application. Adjust speed controls or cushions to lower shock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "-----\n",
      "\n",
      "###### REPLACEMENT PARTS\n",
      "\n",
      " If needed, any cylinder component can be replaced. When contacting a Yates sales representative, please have the following information: model number, bore, stroke or Yates' serial number (as found on the metal tag attached to the cylinder or stamped into the front head) and part description from diagram on page 175.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###### If repair becomes necessary due to seal leakage, a complete rebuild set should be obtained. These sets include piston seals, barrel to head seals, rod seals and bronze rod gland. For seal replacement instruction, refer to pages 176 & 177. (For seal orientation, refer to diagram on page 175.)\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "##### The data model can (and must) extend beyond the smallest common denominator obtained with the partners. The model must therefore contain two levels of information: mandatory data (black boxes) and optional data (grey boxes). Data homogeneity will thereby be ensured by a minimum set of data. Beyond the minimum level, the model serves as a target for all partners. Over the years, we will therefore work towards raising the minimum and redefining new targets. Minimum content will be defined for attributive and geometric data (see Figure 1 – Specifications expansion).\n",

      "#### 2 LRS\n",
      "\n",
      "##### The Linear Reference System (LRS) is considered the most viable approach for managing and distributing geospatial information when several distinct organizations are involved (distributed approach). \n",
      " This method makes it possible to divide a standard spatial object into two parts: the geometric and attribute parts. The geometric part (Network Linear Component in the NHNC1) describes the position of the feature without describing its nature. The attribute part (or event) describes specific information observed along its linear geometric representation. Event information does not alter the geometric representation in any way. The event's position is given relatively from the beginning of the linear geometric representation. A Point Event is determined by a specific location, while a Linear Event is defined by a starting and ending measurement. Several Linear Methods (LRMs) can be used. (They are not discussed in this document). By using this approach we can share a common geometry while each application can add their set of attributes (events) in relationship with the Water Network geometry. \n",

      " Four packages constitute the NHNC1 : Hydro Network, Hydrographic, Hydro Events and Metadata. The Hydro Network package contains the set of classes that form the linear network. The Hydrographic package contains the set of classes that form the graphical representation of features related to the linear network. The Hydro Event package contains attributive information that are referenced to Hydro Network geometry.The Metadata package contains information that describes the data themselves (date, accuracy, and so on). The portion of toponymy associated to Hydro feature data is part of the National Toponymy Model. This model associates geometries with official names and the classes used from the Toponymy Model are described in an external package called Toponymy for better understanding (issues involving text placement on paper or computer screen are excluded from consideration at this point).\n",
