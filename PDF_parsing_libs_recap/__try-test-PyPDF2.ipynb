      "Since our modest beginnings in 1972 as a fluid power products distributor founded by William H. Yates II, Yates \n",
      "Industries has built a reputation for excellence and economy in comprehensive cylinder manufacturing. When William H. Yates III took over the business in 1993, his innovative vision of becoming the leading cylinder manufacturer and repair facility in the U.S. was soon realized. By 1998 the growing demand for Yates quality products and services moved Yates Industries into a state of the art 100,000+ sq. ft. manufacturing facility in St. Clair Shores, Michigan. In 2007, further demand prompted Yates Industries to open an additional 45,000 sq. ft. facility in Decatur Alabama, known as the Yates Alabama Division. \n",
      "With a growing reputation for superior service and support, Yates recently opened our newest operations in 2014 \n",
      "in Austell, Georgia. Adding Georgia to our Michigan and Alabama facilities enables greater capacity for our welded cylinder lines, provides faster turnaround times and increases our service area throughout the Southern US, nationally and internationally. Yates is now one of the largest and most complete cylinder manufacturing companies in the country with three facilities manufacturing pneumatic and hydraulic cylinders, as well as a variety of other fluid power related components.\n",
      "CUSTOMER SERVICE\n",
      "Yates Industries began with the goal of providing exceptional products with superior customer service. 42+ years later, we have exceeded those goals and have earned the reputation for delivering a superior product that not only lasts, but also surpasses its expectations.
