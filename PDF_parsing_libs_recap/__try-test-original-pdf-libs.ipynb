      "Reported allegations of harassment, discrimination or retaliation will be investigated promptly, thoroughly, and impartially. To the extent feasible, complaints will be handled confidentially. Untimely complaints will be investigated to the extent it is still possible. An employee’s failure to report suggests that the employee is not offended by or welcomes the conduct or comments or is otherwise disinterested in having any concerns investigated and/or addressed. The Company may require a written statement and, if required, the employee must provide such a statement. An investigation may include interviews of possible witnesses, including the person alleging that the harassment occurred, and the person or persons claimed to have committed the harassment. The privacy of the person issuing the complaint and of the person accused and the steps taken in the investigation will be protected to the extent reasonably practicable except that the Company will report its findings to the person making the complaint and to the person or persons who are claimed to be involved.\n",

It is the duty of every employee to cooperate in any such investigation.\n",

      "RETALIATION PROHIBITED Yates Industries, Inc. prohibits retaliation against any individual who reports discrimination and harassment or participates in an investigation of such reports. Retaliation against an individual for reporting harassment or discrimination or for participating in an investigation of a claim of harassment or discrimination is a serious violation of this policy and, like harassment or discrimination itself, will be subject to disciplinary action.\n",

Also, all complaints must be brought in good faith. An employee who knowingly makes a false complaint shall be subject to disciplinary action.\n",

Employees may not record in more than five (5) minutes prior to their starting time. Employees must record in at the beginning of their shift and record out at the end of their scheduled shift AND, if leaving the premises at any time (other than for conducting Company business), record out at the time leaving and record back in upon returning. Lunch break is unpaid. All employees are required to record in and out for themselves. Under no circumstances are you to record another employee’s time in. Any discrepancies, errors, or if an employee forgets/misses to record in/out, they must see their Supervisor to have corrected. An employee is expected to commence work immediately after recording in for the day (or after break/lunch). An employee may not enter the building, record in and exit the building to park their vehicle, this is considered falsifying time records and will not be tolerated, such violation is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.\n",

Depending on the type of qualifying event, employees, spouses of employees, and dependent children of employees may be \"qualified beneficiaries.\"\n",

      "1.

      "MOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS Yates Industries' fluid power cylinders can be found in many mounting configurations. The decision on the proper mount should take into consideration what style is best suited for the application at hand. We can break these mounts into 3 groups:\n",
      "\n",
      "CENTERLINE FORCE TRANSFER (Mounts include F,R,G,P,J,S,X,Z,K,L,M,N) These are cylinders with fixed mounts that absorb forces along their center-line in both thrust and tension applications. Mounting bolts are not subjected to compound forces and, if properly installed, sideload damage is removed, extending rod gland life.\n",
      "\n",
      "OFF-CENTERLINE FORCE TRANSFER (Mounts include A, B, E & Y) These are cylinders with fixed mounts that do not absorb forces along their centerline. These mounts tend to produce a twisting in the cylinder as it applies force to a load. To avoid problems, these cylinders must be securely mounted with loads well guided when possible. Depending on application, pinning the mounting lugs or adding an extended key plate may reduce side load to rod gland and piston bearings. Consult factory with questions or concerns with your application.\n",
      "\n",
      "PIVOT FORCE CYLINDERS (Mounts include C, V, DC, DV, Q, U, T & W) These cylinders absorb forces along their centerline and are used when the load must travel in a curved path. The type of mount will depend on the load staying in one curved path or the need to pivot on two axis. Choose the mount based on your application and consult the piston rod selection chart on page 107. For long stroke applications, a larger rod diameter or stop tube may be required.\n",
      "\n",
      "TYP ES OF CYL IND ERS\n",
      "\n",
      "DOUBLE ACTING CYLINDERS This is the most common type of cylinder. This type of cylinder is for use in applications where force is needed in both directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "SINGLE ACTING CYLINDERS This type of cylinder is used when force is needed in only one direction, either extend or retract. Commonly the opposite end of the cylinder is vented to atmosphere, or in a hydraulic application the opposite port can be vented back to the tank. Depending on the application either gravity or the weight of the load will retract the cylinder.\n",
      "\n",
      "DOUBLE ROD CYLINDERS These cylinders can have load attached to both ends of the cylinder and work in both directions. Other applications for double rod cylinders include equal displacement on both sides of the cylinder, or operating switches of cams.\n",

These cylinders are commonly used as clamp cylinders. Note that the addition of a spring can increase the length of a cylinder as much as 3 times or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "RAM CYLINDERS Ram cylinders are commonly known as displacement cylinders. Mainly used for long strokes where gravity or the weight of the load can retract the cylinder and are almost always mounted vertically.\n",
      "\n",
      "TELESCOPIC CYLINDERS Telescopic cylinders are commonly used in mobile equipment and machinery. The multiple “stages” of the cylinders allow applications to get long strokes with short retracted lengths and are available in single or double acting configurations.\n",

      "STATIC ROD LOCKS Yates' new YRL series rod locks offer the next generation in holding/locking devices with superior performance. These spring- engaged, air-released rod locks supplement air cylinders and guide rods for holding in emergency stop or power off conditions. High pressure clamping forces ensure positive holding with minimal air required for lock release.\n",
      "\n",
      "LONG LASTING PERFORMANCE Designed for millions of trouble-free cycles, the YRL rod lock offers a sealed design to withstand even the harshest wash down applications. Spring-engaged design offers operation even in power loss situations. The fast spring response also increases positioning accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "BENEFITS • No rod displacement • Large clamping surface • 2,000,000+ life cycles • Sealed internal components • Extremely low backlash • NFPA sizes\n",
      "\n",
      "APPLICATIONS • Automation equipment • Injection molding machines • Hydraulic presses • Machine tools • Elevators/ scissor lifts\n",
      "\n",
      "OPERATIONAL SPECIFICATIONS: All YRL rod locks will operate in both directions, engaging with the same holding force. Rod locks can be mounted in any position. Rod rotation is not allowed when lock is engaged (not intended for torsional braking).\n",
      "\n",
      "Release pressure can range from 60-120 psi • Buna-N seals are rated to 212°F • Operating temperatures range from 33°F-150°F • Units are capable of intermittent use at temperatures up to 212°F\n",

      "CYLINDER IDENTIFICATION\n",
      "\n",
      "Yates' N.F.P.A. series cylinders can be identified by Yates serial number or model number. Cylinders are tagged with bore, stroke, and serial number on a metal tag attached to the head. In addition, the serial number is stamped into the steel of the front head. These numbers should always be referenced when requesting parts or for general service inquiries.\n",

      "STORING OF CYLINDERS\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is a need to store the cylinders for any period of time, please follow these simple instructions to help keep the cylinder in ready condition:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Coat the interior of the cylinder with oil and leave half filled if practical.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Plug all ports to ensure foreign matter is kept out of the cylinder.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Try to store the cylinder in a vertical position if at all possible; if not, regularly rotate the cylinder 90 degrees to ensure seals maintain proper shape and elasticity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Keep all mounting surfaces and threads either covered or coated with protective lubricant.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Try to store components in a clean, dry area that maintains a relatively constant temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "IF STORING FOR LONGER THAN ONE MONTH, ALWAYS THOROUGHLY LUBRICATE THE CYLINDER. STROKE NUMEROUS TIMES BEFORE INSTALLATION OR USING UNDER LOAD.\n",

      "INSTALLATION\n",
      "\n",
      "The preferred method of mounting the cylinder to a machine is to have the equipment machined to fit the cylinder's exact dimensions with proper alignment already taken into account so that mounting the cylinder ensures perfect alignment. Unfortunately, this is not always an option from a cost or design aspect so alignment must be ensured at time of installation. On fixed mount cylinders that are secured in one position, it is always best to bolt the cylinder down as the last step in installation.\n",
      "\n",
      "When attaching the piston rod end to the load, the piston rod must be attached and held squarely to ensure the centerline is parallel to the guides of the attached load or parallel to the line of movement along the entire stroke. Torque piston rod to load. Insert mounting bolts securely enough to cycle cylinder but do not tighten.\n",
      "\n",
      "The application operation should be cycled with low pressure air under reduced or no load to ensure that all components are operating freely. Finish torquing mounting bolts and re-check.\n",
      "\n",
      "Piping: All fittings should be free of burrs and sealed with either o-ring or appropriate pipe tape. Make sure all hoses are properly flushed of contaminants before attachment. Do not overtighten fittings. On oversized rods, beware of shallow tapped ports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hydraulic filtration should be to power unit manufacturer's specifications. Pneumatic systems should have a water separator, 50 micron or smaller filter, and a lubricator as close to the cylinder as possible.\n",

      "TROUBLESHOOTING\n",
      "\n",
      "Cylinders that are properly installed and maintained should have millions of trouble-free cycles. Most failures are due to application or system problems that could be prevented. Some problems, possible causes and solutions follow:\n",
      "\n",
      "BROKEN ROD END\n",
      "\n",
      "Cause: Misalignment or load in excess of cylinder capability. Solution: Make sure that load is properly aligned. Select larger rod end threads or\n",
      "\n",
      "stud rod end for greater strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. BROKEN OR BENT ROD\n",
      "\n",
      "Cause: Misalignment or load in excess of cylinder capability. Solution: Make sure that rod is aligned properly through entire stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consult a Yates sales representative to select proper rod size for application.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. SEAL DAMAGE\n",
      "\n",
      "Cause: Solution: Consult a Yates sales representative for proper seal for temperature or fluid media.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improper seal selection or system contamination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use proper filtration from system manufacturer's spec.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. EXCESSIVE PISTON ROD WEAR\n",
      "\n",
      "Cause: Solution: Check alignment of rod and load along entire stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Side load or long stroke and improper stop tube selection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consult Yates catalog for proper stop tube configuration.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. BROKEN PARTS Cause:\n",
      "\n",
      "Exceeding cylinder pressure rating. Need for system speed controls or improperly adjusted cylinder cushions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solution: Lower system pressure to minimum required to accommodate application.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adjust speed controls or cushions to lower shock.\n",

      "Abstract— Processing of low-resource languages is one of the most challenging tasks in the area of natural language processing. The lack of datasets makes it complex to create and train corresponding models that are available for high- resource languages. In this paper, the possibility of the usage of the word alignment mechanism for the performing of the cross-lingual tasks has been analyzed for the low-resource language by the example of the Ukrainian language for the solving of the named entity recognition task. Different state-of- the-art word alignment methods have been analyzed. The advisability of the usage of the pre-trained multilingual models for the word alignment of low-resource languages has been shown. The experimental verification of the effectiveness of the chosen word alignment method for the solving of the named entity recognition for a Ukrainian corpus has been performed with different options. The results obtained may indicate the possibility of the usage of the considered word alignment method for the solving of different sequence labeling tasks for the Ukrainian language by performing the cross-lingual mapping of the results for the target English language.\n",

For instance, the multilingual BERT model [5] was pre-trained on a set of texts of different languages that allow utilizing this model for fine-tuning according to the corresponding task [6].

In order to overcome this problem, the word alignment mechanism can be used.\n",

      "The availability of the huge amount of data, and the possibility to process them according to computational power, led the recent advances in different domains [1, 2, 3]. However, the lack of data for the solving of AI-related tasks still should be considered a relevant problem, especially, in the area of natural language processing (NLP). Thus, despite the recent achievements in solving the different kinds of tasks for high-resource languages, the processing of low- resource languages still remains a relevant problem in the area of natural language processing. A high-resource language (e.g., English, Chinese) implies the availability of a the huge amount of corresponding language that allow training models in a supervised or unsupervised manner for the solving of NLP tasks. The NLP problems for these languages are mostly well-studied, and the corresponding different software tools are presented as well. In contrast, low-resource languages can be considered as less studied, less commonly taught, and less privileged [4]. Namely, the main problem consists in the lack of data for these languages, especially for tasks that require the previous labeling of a dataset by experts (e.g., named entity recognition, coreference resolution, etc.). In order to overcome this problem, different approaches can be used.\n",

The availability of such connections allows providing an ability to transfer the results retrieved for the target language (e.g., the English language) to the source-language text by mapping the corresponding words. In the case of low-resource languages, such a technique may help transfer the generated output markup of the high-resource language text to the low-resource language text according to the considered task without using any additional training data (zero-shot cross-lingual transferring [8]).\n",

The word alignment problem was first commonly introduced in the paper [14] that describes a sequence of increasingly complex IBM models: Model 1, Model 2, Model 3, Model 4, and Model 5 (Model 6 was proposed later). The main purpose of IBM models consists in the translation of sentences from one language to another by applying the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for the optimization of parameters. The word alignment was used as a separate intermediate step for the calculation of the conditional is a source- probability where words, language (French) sentence that consists of is a target-language (English) sentence that\n",

The fine-tuning of the multilingual BERT model by taking into account multiple objectives was suggested in the paper [21] for further usage of the embedding of words for the finding of word alignments.

Regarding the metrics values for cross-lingual approaches, all configurations are recall-oriented. Low precision values can be explained by a wrong prediction of the labels of named entities that are most typical for the Ukrainian the following sentence: “The event was held in the House of Culture”. The borders of the named entity “House of Culture” (a common name for major club-houses in some countries) were classified by the English NER model correctly.

As can be seen from the results, the metrics of all cross-lingual approaches are recall-oriented. The precision values are much lower in comparison with other labels. Such results can be explained by the creation of a big number of extra MISC entities that actually are correct for the English language but aren’t relevant for the Ukrainian language. For instance, let’s consider the phrase “the Ukrainian language”. In terms of the English NER, the word “Ukrainian” should be treated as the named entity of a type “MISC”. However, the adjective “Ukrainian” shouldn’t be considered a named entity in the Ukrainian language. Such cases can be created from a large number of adjectives.
