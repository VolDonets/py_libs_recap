# A. INTRODUCTION

## 1. Congratulations!!

Thank you for purchasing TPI products. The meter is easy to use and is built to last. It is backed by a 3 year limited warranty. Please remember to complete and return your product warranty registration card.

## 2. Product Description

The 183A is a hand-held autoranging DMM. The 183A measures ACV, DCV, ACA, DCA, Resistance, Frequency, Duty Cycle, Diodes, Capacitance, Temperature and Continuity.

The 183A also features:

- **REC**  
  Records Min/Max readings during specified measurement intervals.

- **RANGE**  
  Allows the user to manually range the 183A instead of autoranging.

- **HOLD**  
  Holds the reading on the display for easy viewing.

- **REL**  
  Displays the value as a difference to a reference value

- **AUTO OFF**  
  Preserves battery life.

The 183A comes complete with the following accessories:

- 183A Instrument
- Zippered Vinyl Carrying Case
- Rubber Boot
- Test Lead Set
- Instruction Manual



# //COMMENT: page_No: 3
# 3. EC Declaration of Conformity

This is to certify that model 183A conforms to the protection requirements of the council directive 89/336/EEC, in the approximation of laws of the member states relating to Electromagnetic compatibility and 73/23/EEC, The Low Voltage Directive by application of the following standards:

- **EN61326 : 1997 + A1 + A2 : 2001**
- **EN61010-1 : 2001 Safety Standard**

To ensure conformity with these standards, this instrument must be operated in accordance with the instructions and specifications given in this manual.

### CAUTION:
Even though this instrument complies with the immunity standards, the accuracy can be affected by strong radio emissions not covered in the above standards. Sources such as hand held radio transceivers, radio and TV transmitters, vehicle radios and cellular phones generate electromagnetic radiation that could be induced into the test leads of this instrument. Care should be taken to avoid such situations or alternatively, check to make sure that the instrument is not being influenced by these emissions.

# B. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

### WARNING: 
Please follow manufacturers test procedures whenever possible. Do not attempt to measure unknown voltages or components until a complete understanding of the circuit is obtained.

Read instructions before operating:
Be sure these instructions accompany the tool when passed from one user to a new or inexperienced user.

Equipment is used in a manner not specified by the manufacturer, the protection provided by the equipment may be impaired.

## GENERAL GUIDELINES

### ALWAYS
- Test the 183A before using it to make sure it is operating properly.
- Inspect the test leads before using to make sure there are no breaks or shorts.
- Double check all connections before testing.
- Have someone check on you periodically if working alone.
- Have complete understanding of circuit being measured.
- Disconnect power to circuit then, connect test leads to the 183A, then to circuit being measured.

### NEVER
- Attempt to measure unknown high voltages.
- Attempt to measure current with the meter in parallel to the circuit.
- Connect the test leads to a live circuit before setting up the instrument.
- Touch any exposed metal part of the test lead assembly.
