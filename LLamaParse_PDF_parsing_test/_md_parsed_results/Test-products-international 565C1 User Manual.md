# Operating Instructions

1. Push ON button to turn meter on.
2. Pressing the 'C/°F' button will toggle between 'C' and 'F'.
3. Push UNIT button to select the desired display units of the air velocity. 5 units: - m/s, km/s, ft/min, knots, mile/h
4. Position the probe at desired location of measurement.
5. Read the temperature and velocity on the LCD.
6. It will take several minutes until the readings get stable after the probe is positioned.
7. Press "HOLD" button to freeze the display after taking a measurement is finished.
8. "DH" will be displayed on the LCD.
9. Press "HOLD" button again to return to normal operation.

Battery should be replaced when "LBT" is displayed at the top left of the screen.

# Volume Measurements

To determine CFM (cubic feet per minute) in a duct, the area of the duct must first be measured (use the equations below). Then multiply an air velocity measurement by the area measurement to obtain CFM.

## Area Equation for Square Ducts:

- **Area (A) = Height (H) X Width (W)**

## Area Equation for Round Ducts:

- **Area (A) = π X R²**
  - Where π = 3.14
  - R² = (Radius x Radius)

**CFM (ft³/min) = Air Velocity (ft/min) X Area (in square inches) / 144**

# Recording Data

If you want to record the reading changes, press "REC" button when the reading gets stable. Once activated the meter will begin recording.

- The REC annunciator will be displayed. The meter will record minimum, maximum and average temperatures.
- To recall the data after recording, press "RCL" button. The "MAX", "MIN", "AVG" values will be recalled sequentially.
- If you press "RCL" button, both temperature and humidity will be displayed at the same time on the LCD. The screen will display "MAX", "MIN", "AVG" sequentially.

Press "REC" button to return to normal operation. The meter has auto power off feature on normal operation.(10 minutes) Auto power off is disabled on record mode.
