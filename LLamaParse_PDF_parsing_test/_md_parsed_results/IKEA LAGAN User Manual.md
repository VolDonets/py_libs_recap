# Setting and Starting a Programme

## Setting Mode

For some settings it is necessary that the appliance is in setting mode. The appliance is in setting mode when, after the activation, all the programme indicators are on. If the control panel does not show this condition press and hold the programme button until all the programme indicators come on.

## Starting a Programme

1. Open the water tap.
2. Press the on/off button to activate the appliance. Make sure that the appliance is in setting mode.
3. Press Program again and again until only the indicator of the programme you want to set is on.
4. Close the appliance door. The programme starts.


# //COMMENT: page_No: 11
# Opening the door while the appliance operates

If you open the door, the appliance stops. When you close the door, the appliance continues from the point of interruption.

# Cancelling the programme

1. Open the appliance door.
2. Press and hold the programme button until all the programme indicators come on.

   ![info] Make sure that there is detergent in the detergent dispenser before you start a new programme.

# At the end of the programme

The end indicator comes on.

1. Press the on/off button to deactivate the appliance.
2. Close the water tap.

   ![info] If you do not press the on/off button, after few minutes from the end of the programme all the indicators go off. This helps to decrease the energy consumption.

   ![info] 
   - Let the dishes become cold before you remove them from the appliance. Hot dishes can be easily damaged.
   - First remove the items from the lower basket, then from the upper basket.
   - There can be water on the sides and on the door of the appliance. Stainless steel becomes cool more quickly than the dishes.

# Hints and tips

## The water softener

Hard water contains a high quantity of minerals that can cause damage to the appliance and bad washing results. The water softener neutralises these minerals. The dishwasher salt keeps the water softener clean and in good conditions. It is important to set the right level of the water softener. This makes sure that the water softener uses the correct quantity of dishwasher salt and water.

## Loading the baskets

![info] Refer to the supplied leaflet with examples of the load of the baskets.

- Only use the appliance to wash items that are dishwasher-safe.
- Do not put in the appliance items made of wood, horn, aluminium, pewter and copper.
- Do not put in the appliance items that can absorb water (sponges, household cloths).
- Remove remaining food from the items.
- To remove easily remaining burned food, soak pots and pans in water before you put them in the appliance.
- Put hollow items (cups, glasses and pans) with the opening down.
- Make sure that cutlery and dishes do not bond together. Mix spoons with other cutlery.
- Make sure that glasses do not touch other glasses.
- Put the small items in the cutlery basket.
- Put the light items in the upper basket. Make sure that they do not move.
- Make sure that the spray arms can move freely before you start a programme.

## Using salt, rinse aid and detergent

- Only use salt, rinse aid and detergent for dishwasher. Other products can cause damage to the appliance.
- The rinse aid helps, during the last rinsing phase, to dry the dishes without streaks and stains.


# //COMMENT: page_No: 12
# Care and Cleaning

- Combi detergent tablets contain detergent, rinse aid and other added agents. Be sure that these tablets are applicable to the water hardness in your area. Refer to the instructions on the packaging of the products.
- Detergent tablets do not fully dissolve with short programmes. To prevent detergent residues on the tableware, we recommend that you use the tablets with long programmes.
- Do not use more than the correct quantity of detergent. Refer to the instructions on the detergent packaging.

## Before starting a programme

Make sure that:
- The filters are clean and correctly installed.
- The spray arms are not clogged.
- The position of the items in the baskets is correct.
- The programme is applicable for the type of load and for the degree of soil.
- The correct quantity of detergent is used.
