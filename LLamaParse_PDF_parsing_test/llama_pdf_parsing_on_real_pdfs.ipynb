      "## Quick Tips\n",
      "\n",
      "1. All pushrods in a set do not wear evenly or uniformly. Over time each will wear in a unique fashion as it “mates” with the individual rocker arm that it is paired with. Consequently, old pushrods should be replaced when new rocker arms are installed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Make sure rocker arms and other components are well lubricated. Proper lubrication of all parts can help prevent premature wear and/or permanent damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Check for any interference between rockers and valve covers.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Always use hardened shafts. Stock or unhardened shafts will result in premature wear and rocker arm failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Make sure oil holes on shafts are facing down.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Installation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 1\n",
      "After removing the rockers and other components from the package thoroughly wash each piece, and then blow dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2\n",
      "Totally submerge the rockers in engine oil for approximately 30 minutes prior to installation to ensure the needle bearings are lubricated.\n",
      "# Step 3\n",
      "Begin assembly by mounting rocker arms, washers, and spacers onto the shaft. Big block rockers are offset, make sure to place proper rockers on intake and exhaust valves. **NOTE:** Over the years, various cylinder head designs by Chrysler/Mopar require “shims” to properly locate the rocker arms on the shaft. Shims from .005” and larger may be needed. Valve spring shims may be used for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Step 4\n",
      "Install the pushrods. Make sure the pushrod is properly seated in lifter.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Step 5\n",
      "Loosen pushrod adjusters. Position the rocker assembly onto the head. Tighten down bolts evenly until each is torqued to 15-17 foot-pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Step 6\n",
      "Turn all the pushrod adjusters down until the ball end enters the pushrod, if you have cup end adjusters turn until ball end of pushrod enters the adjuster’s cup. Do not tighten beyond this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Step 7\n",
      "Hand turn the crank in the running rotation until the exhaust valve starts to open. Now, set the intake valve by tightening down the pushrod adjuster until there is no end play in the pushrod. This will bring you to zero lash. Tighten the adjuster one more full turn then tighten the lock nut.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Step 8\n",
      "Next, hand turn the crank in the running rotation until the pushrod has reached maximum lift and is between one half and two thirds of the way down. Then adjust the exhaust valve using the same procedure as described in step #7 for the intake valve.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Step 9\n",
      "When using mechanical lifters use the same procedure, but instead of zero lash use the clearance specified by your cam sheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Step 10\n",
      "Before installing valve covers, check for proper clearance between rockers and valve covers. Then pour engine oil over rocker arms to insure proper lubrication on initial start up. Finally, replace the valve covers on the heads.\n",
